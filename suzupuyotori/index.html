      <p>
        Good morning Loves ♡
      </p>
      <p>
        Today marks my graduation from AuroraLiveVR due to personal health reasons. However, I would like to thank the staff,
        managers, and members of AuroraLiveVR for all of the knowledge and care you've shown me, as well as welcoming me so
        warmly into Kaleidosekai. I hope you can continue to support them for all of their hard work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The streams pre-debut and Suzu's debut itself was such a lovely journey for me, and I have a very special place in my
        heart for my experiences in my time at the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to thank all of my pengus above all for sticking with me through this journey of mine and offering so
        much of your support and kindness, always. Without you, I am not sure where I would be. All of the love you've given
        me has improved my life immensely.
      </p>
      <p>
        ♡ This is not a goodbye. ♡ I will continue to use this Twitter and my Twitch for lurks & chats. However, this marks
        the end of my journey with AuroraLiveVR. I love you all so much and I hope you will continue to support me and that we
        can share loving memories and laughs together!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Big hugs,
      </p>
      <p>
        Mwah! ˚ʚ♡ɞ˚

      </p>
      <p>
        these past few months have been very drastic but fun as I get more involved into the vtuber community, and met new
        fwens along the way!! from my first official invocation since 5 July as Kaiser Insight-カイザーインサイト-, to becoming
        Mother Agatha 【アガサお母さん】, everything felt like a dream come true!!
      </p>
      <p>
        but now, it's time for me to grasp on the new set of opportunities and challenges as I tackle on my role as a part of
        AuroraLiveVR!!
      </p>
      <p>
        but don't worry -- I'll still be the same 💚🍃Aga-chuu💗🌸 that you always loved!! ehehe

      <p>
        looking forward to spending the new memories with all of you!! 💚🍃Aga-chuu loves you uwu💗🌸
