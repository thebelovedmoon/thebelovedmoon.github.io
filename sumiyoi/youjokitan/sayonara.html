        <h1>Farewell, 「Mahoroba Youjo Kitan」.</h1>
        <h3>12 Aug 2020 - 30 Jun 2022 JST</h3>
        <p>
          It's been almost two years since the game came out as Japanese
          Edition, with the following year as Global Edition. I really had fun
          playing the game when I initially got it but haven't got around to
          playing it in the long run due to circumstances. So far, I've been
          playing it occasionally once to thrice per two weeks to engage myself
          in such a universe that I longed to exist for longer.
          <br /><br />
          But as they all said, 「all good things must come to an end」, and
          this is no exception. I really longed for this game -- among others
          that I played -- to last longer than usual, but we can't just decide
          on its fate on our own. We should understand the developers'
          circumstances and their decision to pull the game (including its
          assets) off of all platforms as soon as the timer reaches zero. We
          just hope that we can wish for such derivatives that was inspired by
          this game (or if possible, a sequel to the original like what Cygames
          did with Princess Connect) to thrive even longer than what I imagined.
          <br /><br />
          I could hope that one day, when the seal encapsuling the 「World of
          the Yokai」 is once again removed, their story is once again being
          told to the masses -- both new and experienced. I could only hope that
          one day, their efforts that the once lost will soon bear fruit.
          <br /><br />
          Starting this week, I'll mainly focus on either of the following:
          <br />
          - Making musical derivations based on the original BGMs<br />
          - Stream the game with 1hr minimum<br />
          - Commemorate its shutdown event by the end of the month
        </p>
        <br />
        <div class="ltr">
          Fusion Studio,
          <p class="par">
            I would like to give my deepest regards to all of you who have been
            the brains behind the frameworks of this special game. Although it
            might have been very short-lived as I didn't expect, it still
            remains as one of the games that are close to my heart. I understand
            your circumstances and your intentions on not supporting this game
            any longer, and we will accept it with all of our heart.
          </p>
          <p class="par">
            As the game finally draws to a close, we're to be reminded about the
            accomplishments that we had that made the universe better with each
            passing moment. May we hope that one day, when we have the courage
            to put our trust in ourselves and everyone around us, we can safely
            reopen the universe that we called "our own". And hopefully, we get
            the chance to see the players -- new and experienced -- relive the
            experience that they lost.
          </p>
          <p class="par">
            Thank you for all the memories that you shared with us players
            throughout the years. We'll remember this as not being one of the
            short-lived games that come and go, but as one of those closest to
            us that redefine our experiences as a whole -- outside of the game.
            Godspeed, Mahoroba Youjo Kitan!
