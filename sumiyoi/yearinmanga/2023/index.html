              we've shifted the focus to our lovely Idols who have gone beyond what was allowed
              to tell us the story about their hardships, their achievements, and their attempts
              at love. and it's not just the Idols that we usually see in concerts and
              television -- it can go as far as cabaret clubs, a train station, to even in the
              classroom!

                    One of the two primary hallmarks of the year&#39;s manga lineup!! This is how
                    we come up with a prime example of dealing with our dearest Idols with the
                    best we can!!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Shuta has been very keen on supporting Hiyori ever since she was Dream+&#39;s
                    Haru, that he&#39;s doing whatever he can to support her dreams and to rule
                    out any uncertainties that come in her way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I would like to personally applaud Yoshie for her support towards Hiyori
                    despite the circumstances -- it makes me think that there&#39;s still much to
                    be done to alleviate the suffering the Idols have inflicted.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Echoing the words of @GoodOlFiddle: &quot;Idols make people smile but they
                    don&#39;t have anyone to make <strong>them</strong> smile.&quot;
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Going out-of-character for a bit: I know a friend who knows a lot of Idol
                    friends from Japan that they only interact on X (Twitter). There&#39;s also an
                    Idol from that circle that he&#39;s closely fond of that he&#39;s willing to
                    do whatever it takes to support her in any way he can. In my personal case, I
                    have some interactions with some of them -- VTubers even -- that have been a
                    part of my life that I&#39;ve been willing to support them in whatever I can.
                    (That&#39;s also why I founded the Marias in honor of the two VTubers who have
                    been the primary reasons I can keep going throughout the day with
                    determination.)

                    Another one of the two primary hallmarks of the year&#39;s manga lineup!! This
                    is a remark that regardless of which lifestyle you connect yourself into,
                    there&#39;s still gonna be ways for love to prosper in all directions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yo&#39;s profession as a florist has attracted a number of customers, that it
                    had the attention of the customers from a specific cabaret club -- where
                    Shinobu used to work. The past history both had shared (which was revealed in
                    the later parts of the story) has rekindled their feelings, though I&#39;m
                    fairly certain that it&#39;s the memories along the way that made them bond
                    together like a strong glue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Overall, the experience was worth the wait as I&#39;ve come across this many
                    times; it&#39;s actually refreshing to see related stories that anticipates
                    one&#39;s heart to be able to reap the fruit of love and labor.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In any case, Yo has melted Shinobu&#39;s icy heart and bloomed with hazel
                    flowers on their souls.

                    One of the lone winners of this lineup!! This has captured the essence of
                    cabaret clubs, perseverance, and a Yomeiri Kousou-like harem experience!!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    AoHaru Manga Library made its mark in the video manga genre with repeated
                    names such as Keiichi, Nagisa, Yui, and Noa. But regardless of the
                    nameschemes, it&#39;s the stories that draws me in to the genre, and this is
                    one of them!!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Keiichi Sato works at some sort of a cabaret club (that somehow has a similar
                    vibe like the last one), but then gets ridiculed by no other than Narita.
                    (That name sounds awful imo.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Anyhow, what followed was a slew of circumstances and ways to work out sets of
                    issues; as well as finding ways to challenge the norm. In the end, the three
                    -- Noa, Yui, and Nagisa -- had their hearts inch closer to Keiichi&#39;s.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Quoting @RayKaz25: &quot;Sometimes it takes a real man to become the best
                    girl.&quot; This points to the fact that Keiichi had gone undercover (as
                    Keina) to rule out Noa&#39;s biggest circumstance in the story. Narita got
                    what he deserved in the end, which is a nice outcome I&#39;d like to see from
                    a typical antagonist.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Out-of-character, Keiichi being Keina is probably what I&#39;ll be feeling
                    when I do feminine-related things. And since I&#39;ll be doing cosplays,
                    I figured I&#39;ll take on that approach.

              series catering to Idol-like stories full of uncertainties and love!! this has been
              curated with a vision that Idols are humans too -- a concept that's mostly overlooked
              by the public.

            <p>
              this playlist covers a wide variety of stories from Idols, to girls from cabaret
              clubs, to individuals whose spirit closely resembles one of both!!
            </p>
            <p>
              accompanied in this playlist are the first two winning stories of this year's lineup:
              Shuta and Hiyori, and Yo and Shinobu!! their remarkable experiences and how they
              found love became the series' hallmark of many related genres to come forward with
              their own!!
