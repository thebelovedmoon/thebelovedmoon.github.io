                    The UNDISPUTED NUMBER ONE in the whole list, and the very first in both the
                    Recommended and Most-Loved Collection! The story of Reiji Otoki and Eva
                    Sanctuary proved that no matter how much struggle you put yourself on, you can
                    always have someone to lean on and will always be with you throughout your
                    life!

                  <p>
                    Personally, were it not for this trope I wouldn&#39;t be able to invest in
                    other of similar interests like this... the story is immense and provided a
                    quick grasp of the situation about betrayal and hope that came along with it.
                    Betrayals that seem too good to be true, but can happen around us if we
                    don&#39;t pay close attention.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All in all, it&#39;s worth a read, and I&#39;m looking forward to seeing the
                    equivalents of this subject matter!

                    Toru Sakuraba and Aoi Usui are what crossed the boundaries between an idol and
                    her number one fan. I mean, it also made sense how this storyline evolved from
                    such a trope that might consider a burden for all idols in real life. Think
                    about it: The idols being given freedom as a person to do whatever they want,
                    which, of course, doesn&#39;t always happen; and once it did, it became a
                    downfall for the idol.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The treatment that Aoi&#39;s manager gave to her was tremendous and the fact
                    that she gave support to Toru saying &quot;to treat Aoi as just a girl&quot;
                    really sparked the flame of love that will forever be eternal for the rest of
                    their lives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I&#39;m envisioning an idol industry that could do just that, and although I
                    have some friends who are familiar with idols, one of them could forge that
                    similar fate as seen here.

                    Matsumoto overcame the odds in unfamiliar ways. I mean, I&#39;ve seen the

                    woman&#39;s mind is utterly different that we might think.

                    lives of Kensuke Tsutsumi and Nanami Omoto in an odd relationship between an
                    employee and a utility worker. It deserves to be a part of this list because
                    it teaches us how to be kind not only to our colleagues, but to everyone
                    around the company and beyond.

                  <p>
                    This story warmed my heart personally because of Kensuke&#39;s perseverance
                    and persistence to keep Nanami out of trouble made the latter fall in love
                    with him. And yeah, Kuzuo Tanaka can eat his own trash!

                    state of society within the workplace, which led her to Kensuke in the end!

                    This might be the only entrant (in the Kent Honda-Mary Toyota universe) that
                    made it through top 25 even though I have a LOT in my Most-Loved. Reason?
                    Partly because there&#39;s a lot of variations of it that I can&#39;t choose
                    which one of them is the winner.

                  <p>
                    But majority is because of the sheer support of someone who will never gonna
                    let you down (no rickroll involved) despite the circumstances and the
                    heartache. Sara Mitsubishi is a gold-digger and she deserved that position --

                    true in the end! Truly a rewarding sight to behold!

                    Sho Hagiwara and Yuuna are among the perfect definitions of commitment and
                    love beyond borders, and certainly the rays of hope in their darkest times!
                    It&#39;s a little sad that Yuuna had an accident a year before the story was

                    you.&quot; I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be a footnote for all the deeds that we do
                    every day.

                    This is one of these mangas that were told from a female&#39;s perspective,
                    and somehow it feels like a nice change of pace! Akari Ogawa may look like an
                    introvert, but she has a good heart and always cares for people! Akari and Jun
                    sharing the same boat cuz the latter helped her before was her inspiration to
                    do almost the same, and hopefully -- like I said in the comments -- that they
                    will be together in episode 2!!

                    To be honest, I can relate to Kengo Abe that much because he tried to be
                    competent for his superior, Rei Usami, despite the circumstances. And I can
                    feel the same for the latter because of the same feeling.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Kengo was the type of your usual worker who always gets picked on by their
                    superiors despite being competent, and the usual that sucks at house
                    management. Meanwhile, Rei is a tough woman who bosses around him but knows
                    about the circumstances that she had with her mother. That kind of chemistry
                    is what made me hooked on to this story!

                    Hijiri Yodaka may look dull and gloomy, but deep inside he&#39;s someone
                    who&#39;s been persevering through a lot given the hardships he faced. And it
                    seems that his motivation that stemmed from Hinshino&#39;s gave him the push
                    to keep going.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On the other hand, it&#39;s ironic that Ageha Nomura was rich but at the same
                    time the personification of the WORST type of people that you don&#39;t want
                    to be friends with. (Of course I&#39;m not talking Ageha Kurosaki, it&#39;s a
                    whole different story.) But it all seemed worse in the long run as Hoshino had
                    perceived, and she became miserable. Part of me wishes to mock her because of
                    that long-run attitude that led her to this fate, but Hijiri forgave her
                    anyway cuz she admitted fully to her mistakes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Looking back at this story a couple of times, it states that &quot;no matter
                    how rich or poor someone is, if given that humbleness and sympathy are always
                    at hand, they&#39;ll look for ways to destine themselves together&quot;. And
                    it seems that in preceding parts of the story states so. Hijiri becoming who
                    he is, and Ageha paying back his gratitude after everything she&#39;d done to
                    him.. I would wonder if Hoshino is their wingman if they&#39;re willing to be
                    honest with their feelings?

                    Manga Character Sprinklers have this usual trope of using Yuto Tanaka as the
                    main character. But why on this list, you may ask?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This right here, with Reika Hayasaka.. or Himuro? I could tell that this trope
                    had quite a few similarities with no.11 so I won&#39;t delve much into the
                    details, but what makes it differ is that it&#39;s evident that Reika -- being
                    the boss -- has some natural feelings for Yuto in the first place! That first
                    telework was just a fluke to some of his coworkers, but I can&#39;t fathom why
                    she wouldn&#39;t be honest to him straight up! That was rectified in later
                    parts of the story as I&#39;ve reviewed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It&#39;s.. not that unusual for a boss to fall in love sometimes with their
                    subordinate especially when they know about those competencies.. but they
                    aren&#39;t being honest with themselves so that&#39;s why there&#39;s a trope
                    like this. I wonder how it applies to the real world, though..

                    Parents are supposed to be the last line of support when things go downhill,
                    but from Akira&#39;s perspective, it appears it always wasn&#39;t the case.
                    From the attitude of his &quot;biased&quot; parents, it&#39;s a good thing
                    that he let them go. The problem is, I don&#39;t understand how his sister,
                    Nagi, doesn&#39;t say anything in the first place. But somehow, it gave me a
                    sense of relief that she stood up for him, knowing that he stood up to her
                    long ago.

                    That kind of chemistry between siblings is enough to make me say that siblings
                    that understands together will stick together in the end. And oh, &quot;family
                    doesn&#39;t call their family &#39;trash&#39;&quot; is the main turning point
                    cuz most parents (as far as I know) are toxic when they reached a tipping
                    point!

                    I could say props to Suzuka for trying to understand him above all things

                    the end, she also looked up to him for all the help and tries to be with him
                    for the rest of her life!! Looking forawrd on how that story will evolve in
                    the near future~

                    yet never takes responsibility when those children are a failure.&quot;

                    Haruto Tanabe is the perfect example of how to stand up against society
                    despite the appearance! Sure, he was gloomy and a nerd, but don&#39;t
                    underestimate -- quoting one from @blacktianime6595 that &quot;anime teaches
                    us something that our parents, instructors and teachers can&#39;t like

                    appears to be open and honest afterwards. So, to me, it&#39;s a plus that she

                    This is another one of the related tropes where Yuto Tanaka is the main

                    wonder if I still become an introvert at this rate.

                    But screw Takahashi! He may be famous for his looks but looking down on others

                    Sure, they were both struggling since Kazuya is stressed out at work and
                    Miyuki became the CEO at a young age, but their resilience and perseverance
                    overcame against all odds and made them get close to each other!!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I&#39;m really hoping that this trope will be a norm in future mangas,
                    considering its lessons and experiences afterwards.

                    he went out of his way for someone&#39;s sake like Rin Okura who&#39;s
                    delivering pizzas while wearing a Santa mini-skirt really sets the standard on

                    I can&#39;t tell, but there&#39;s a reason why this deserves to be among the

                    her Hashiyaku), it implies a twisted story where Haruaki Abeno is interested
                    to investigate. But I don&#39;t know how that also connected to the

                    I can&#39;t say much because it&#39;s already in there, but to give a quick
                    scope of what&#39;s happening: Rui was hailed by Irumi Kijyo despite being
                    incompetent (that caused his dismissal in a short time following this story)
                    because of his prowess and absolute knowledge about technology, to the point
                    where his revered creation -- TOA-chan -- is doing everything for his sake as
                    a payback.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Both Irumi and Aoi Shirayuki deserved to have someone like Rui, in which --
                    let&#39;s face it, turned them into rivals! But TOA-chan also joined the
                    pact.. oh no.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    And I have to say it again, the womanizer and the exec deserved that sheer
                    punishment without any recourse!

                    I can say that this relates much to the likes of Reiji and Eva, but it took an

                    Anyhow, this actually reminded me of the times when Reiji was also being badly
                    rumored because of his prowess, that Hayato seethed in on the same fate.. of
                    course, Lunafer proved everyone wrong by progressing parts of the story.
                    She&#39;s like Eva in disguise -- looking for ways to support her Eiji. This..

              their support for each other has captivated its audience that even Sakura herself
