            <p>
              The UNDISPUTED NUMBER ONE in the whole list, and the very first in both the Recommended and Most-Loved Collection!
              The story of Reiji Otoki and Eva Sanctuary proved that no matter how much struggle you put yourself on, you can
              always have someone to lean on and will always be with you throughout your life!
            </p>
            <p>
              Personally, were it not for this trope I wouldn't be able to invest in other of similar interests like this... the
              story is immense and provided a quick grasp of the situation about betrayal and hope that came along with it.
              Betrayals that seem too good to be true, but can happen around us if we don't pay close attention.
            </p>
            <p>
              All in all, it's worth a read, and I'm looking forward to seeing the equivalents of this subject matter! ABSOLUTE
              ∞/10!!

            <p>
              Toru Sakuraba and Aoi Usui are what crossed the boundaries between an idol and her number one fan. I mean, it also
              made sense how this storyline evolved from such a trope that might consider a burden for all idols in real life.
              Think about it: The idols being given freedom as a person to do whatever they want, which, of course, doesn't
              always happen; and once it did, it became a downfall for the idol.
            </p>
            <p>
              The treatment that Aoi's manager gave to her was tremendous and the fact that she gave support to Toru saying "to
              treat Aoi as just a girl" really sparked the flame of love that will forever be eternal for the rest of their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm envisioning an idol industry that could do just that, and although I have some friends who are familiar with
              idols, one of them could forge that similar fate as seen here.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first in the duology of Kaede and Nanami, where Wataru Kuroda and Kaede Matsumoto overcame the odds in unfamiliar
              ways. I mean, I've seen the comments about Kaede lacking sense, and I can agree... Sometimes, a woman's mind is utterly
              different that we might think.
            </p>
            <p>
              But her persistence despite the fact that she's about to give up gave him the chance to love her for what she really is,
              regardless of social status.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'd say 8/10 cuz of the criticisms against Kaede, but it's still a worthy read nonetheless!

            <p>
              The second in the duology of Kaede and Nanami, where this time, we get to the lives of Kensuke Tsutsumi and Nanami Omoto
              in an odd relationship between an employee and a utility worker. It deserves to be a part of this list because it teaches
              us how to be kind not only to our colleagues, but to everyone around the company and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
              This story warmed my heart personally because of Kensuke's perseverance and persistence to keep Nanami out of trouble made
              the latter fall in love with him. And yeah, Kuzuo Tanaka can eat the trash!
            </p>
            <p>
              And let's not forget that Nanami became a utility worker to evaluate the state of society within the workplace, which led
              her to Kensuke in the end!

              This feels like Detroit: Become Human except that it's actually not. Nevertheless, this presents a story of how
              Itsuki Sato got to know Yuri Nakayama despite the hidden emotions the latter possessed because of circumstances.
              And the fact that Itsuki did whatever he could to protect Yuri got her to appreciate him more.

              Takashi Nishino and Erika Hanazono were another equivalents of Wataru and Kaede, but this time, it's far more than
              just being in that kind of relationship! Sure, Erika can be a bit stubborn, so it'll take some kind of wit and
              determination to be able to open her heart to someone she admired the most.

            <p>
              And let's not forget -- Ayano Maeda being the wingwoman in this story!! I might have to say she deserves her own

              This is where it hits to the bone -- Shohei working really hard to support himself and eventually his
              own family struck a positive impact about perseverance and determination. And of course, the fact that
              he helped the poor father and daughter -- Hiroshi and Yuki -- become the best in themselves drawn a
              heart in my chest, hoping that most people do it for others' sake.
            </p>
            <p>
              And let's not forget -- Shohei giving Yuki's mother and her love affair a lesson is so smooth, Yuki
              already made up her mind! Can't believe he was a former delinquent, though -- still!

              This might be the only entrant (in the Kent Honda-Mary Toyota universe) that made it through top 25 even though
              I have a LOT in my Most-Loved. Reason? Partly because there's a lot of variations of it that I can't choose
              which one of them is the winner.
            </p>
            <p>
              But majority is because of the sheer support of someone who will never gonna let you down (no rickroll involved)
              despite the circumstances and the heartache. Sara Mitsubishi is a gold-digger and she deserved that position --
              no less!
            </p>
            <p>
              As for my perceptions about Kent and Mary, it remained the same throughout the variations and all I can say is
              hats off to them for making their dreams come true in the end! Truly a rewarding sight to behold!

              Sho Hagiwara and Yuuna are among the perfect definitions of commitment and love beyond borders, and certainly
              the rays of hope in their darkest times! It's a little sad that Yuuna had an accident a year before the story
              was told, but it all paid off in the end thanks to Shou's perseverance.
            </p>
            <p>
              I kinda hate Yuuna's mother to some degree, but there has to be a reason. Either way, she owned up to her
              mistakes in the end and wished both of them the best in their endeavors.
            </p>
            <p>
              I still won't forget the quote Yuuna said to him: &quot;Nothing good comes from being kind... But if you do
              good things, they'll come back to you.&quot; I'm sure it'll be a footnote for all the deeds that we do every

              This is one of these mangas that were told from a female's perspective, and somehow it feels like a
              nice change of pace! Akari Ogawa may look like an introvert, but she has a good heart and always
              cares for people! Akari and Jun sharing the same boat cuz the latter helped her before was her
              inspiration to do almost the same, and hopefully -- like I said in the comments -- that they will
              be together in episode 2!!
            </p>

              Shame on Erika, though.

              To be honest, I can relate to Kengo Abe that much because he tried to be competent for his superior, Rei
              Usami, despite the circumstances. And I can feel the same for the latter because of the same feeling.
            </p>
            <p>
              Kengo was the type of your usual worker who always gets picked on by their superiors despite being
              competent, and the usual that sucks at house management. Meanwhile, Rei is a tough woman who bosses around
              him but knows about the circumstances that she had with her mother. That kind of chemistry

              Hijiri Yodaka may look dull and gloomy, but deep inside he's someone who's been persevering through a lot given
              the hardships he faced. And it seems that his motivation that stemmed from Hinshino's gave him the push to keep
              going.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, it's ironic that Ageha Nomura was rich but at the same time the personification of the WORST
              type of people that you don't want to be friends with. (Of course I'm not talking Ageha Kurosaki, it's a whole
              different story.) But it all seemed worse in the long run as Hoshino had perceived, and she became miserable.
              Part of me wishes to mock her because of that long-run attitude that led her to this fate, but Hijiri forgave
              her anyway cuz she admitted fully to her mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking back at this story a couple of times, it states that &quot;no matter how rich or poor someone is, if
              given that humbleness and sympathy are always at hand, they'll look for ways to destine themselves together&quot;.
              And it seems that in preceding parts of the story states so. Hijiri becoming who he is, and Ageha paying back his
              gratitude after everything she'd done to him.. I would wonder if Hoshino is their wingman if they're willing to
              be honest with their feelings?

              Manga Character Sprinklers have this usual trope of using Yuto Tanaka as the main character. But why on this
              list, you may ask?
            </p>
            <p>
              This right here, with Reika Hayasaka.. or Himuro? I could tell that this trope had quite a few similarities
              with no.11 so I won't delve much into the details, but what makes it differ is that it's evident that Reika
              -- being the boss -- has some natural feelings for Yuto in the first place! That first telework was just a
              fluke to some of his coworkers, but I can't fathom why she wouldn't be honest to him straight up! That was
              rectified in later parts of the story as I've reviewed.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's.. not that unusual for a boss to fall in love sometimes with their subordinate especially when they know
              about those competencies.. but they aren't being honest with themselves so that's why there's a trope like
              this. I wonder how it applies to the real world, though..
            </p>
            <p>
              10/10 we need more trope of this!!

            <p>
              The only ATTACK ON MIKA manga that made it through this list!! And, of course, it's for a reason.
            </p>
            <p>
              Parents are supposed to be the last line of support when things go downhill, but from Akira's perspective,
              it appears it always wasn't the case. From the attitude of his "biased" parents, it's a good thing that he
              let them go. The problem is, I don't understand how his sister, Nagi, doesn't say anything in the first
              place. But somehow, it gave me a sense of relief that she stood up for him, knowing that he stood up to her
              long ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              That kind of chemistry between siblings is enough to make me say that siblings that understands together
              will stick together in the end. And oh, &quot;family doesn't call their family 'trash'&quot; is the main
              turning point cuz most parents (as far as I know) are toxic when they reached a tipping point!
            </p>
            <p>
              I could say props to Suzuka for trying to understand him above all things despite the circumstances! Although
              her outcome is opposed to Akira's, in the end, she also looked up to him for all the help and tries to be
              with him for the rest of her life!! Looking forawrd on how that story will evolve in the near future~
            </p>
            <p>
              Quoted by @SatoshiKenji in the comments: &quot;I always hate parents like these. They want to claim bragging
              rights when they have succesful children, yet never takes responsibility when those children are a failure.&quot;

              Haruto Tanabe is the perfect example of how to stand up against society despite the appearance!
              Sure, he was gloomy and a nerd, but don't underestimate -- quoting one from @blacktianime6595
              that &quot;anime teaches us something that our parents, instructors and teachers can't like
              something we didn't understand ourselves, what's important to us, saw our reflection in the
              anime and others that our parents and teachers didn't teaches us something else&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, the chemistry with Yukari is a little complicated, even for me; but it seems that
              in the next few parts following her cosplay as Marilyn she appears to be open and honest
              afterwards. So, to me, it's a plus that she changed because of Haruto -- as evident in the end.

              Shohei Fujinami.. rather, Shohei Sasaki and Iori Honda were previously rivals which surprises me because

              At best, she did everything she could to stay close to him, which motivated him to make the move and step

              This is another one of the related tropes where Yuto Tanaka is the main character. But as an introvert,
              I can say I'm surprised -- it begs me to wonder if I still become an introvert at this rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              But screw Takahashi! He may be famous for his looks but looking down on others is his biggest flaw, and
              that is a big no-no for me! I'm glad that both Sakura Hiiragi and Iijima set that straight and exposed
              that flaw because they can't stand it anymore! If anything, it kinda reminds me of someone I know who's
              been associating with two women that he got the closest to. I wonder what the trio was doing as of late..

              This, among the ones on this list, touched me by the heart! Kazuya Hirakawa and Miyuki Koga are the definitions
              of supporting each other amidst the circumstances!!
            </p>
            <p>
              I won't get into much detail, but looking at them -- with Mafuyu as their wingwoman -- being with each other since
              they first met is a sight to behold! Sure, they were both struggling since Kazuya is stressed out at work and
              Miyuki became the CEO at a young age, but their resilience and perseverance overcame against all odds and made them
              get close to each other!!
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm really hoping that this trope will be a norm in future mangas, considering its lessons and experiences afterwards.

              I can applaud Souta Amemiya for being humble and competent, and the fact that he went out of his way
              for someone's sake like Rin Okura who's delivering pizzas while wearing a Santa mini-skirt really
              sets the standard on how we people deal with each other regardless of appearance! Shame on her
              previous manager, though.. he deserved that punishment!
            </p>
            <p>
              In essence, I call it a happy Christmas gift!!

              I ran out of time to review this material, but I got around to watching it a couple of times to
              say that NTR is no good at all. Hikaru Irie deserves no less!
            </p>
            <p>
              I gotta say, props to Runa Sawai for making him feel better after that sort of betrayal because
              in later parts of the story she brung up that he once helped him before, and she desired to pay
              back the gratitude!
            </p>
            <p>
              And, as always, shame on Arisa and Yuki!
            </p>

              Also, I didn't realize mid-typing this that Runa won the beauty contest THREE YEARS in a row
              while Arisa is the runner-up for TWO YEARS?! What irony..

              His persistence became fruitful because right after the split from the annoying Kuzuma, and because of his endless

            <p>
              I can't tell, but there's a reason why this deserves to be among the list. Following the Japanese urban
              legend of Hasshaku (for some reason I call her Hashiyaku), it implies a twisted story where Haruaki
              Abeno is interested to investigate. But I don't know how that also connected to the "Mountain Princess"
              legend, because..
            </p>
            <p>
              Of what happened to a girl who went missing and became a Mountain Princess herself.
            </p>
            <p>
              But in the end, there's no curse -- but a bond that made them strong.. agh, I can't focus on all this!

              Rui Hamamatsu. The myth. The legend. Who graduated in high school.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can't say much because it's already in there, but to give a quick scope of what's happening: Rui was
              hailed by Irumi Kijyo despite being incompetent (that caused his dismissal in a short time following
              this story) because of his prowess and absolute knowledge about technology, to the point where his
              revered creation -- TOA-chan -- is doing everything for his sake as a payback.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both Irumi and Aoi Shirayuki deserved to have someone like Rui, in which -- let's face it, turned them
              into rivals! But TOA-chan also joined the pact.. oh no.
            </p>
            <p>
              And I have to say it again, the womanizer and the exec deserved that sheer punishment without any
              recourse!

              I can say that this relates much to the likes of Reiji and Eva, but it took an unexpected turn as
              Hayato Kuromine accompanies the Demon Lord Lunafer?!
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyhow, this actually reminded me of the times when Reiji was also being badly rumored because of
              his prowess, that Hayato seethed in on the same fate.. of course, Lunafer proved everyone wrong
              by progressing parts of the story. She's like Eva in disguise -- looking for ways to support her
              Eiji. This.. this I can relate much.
