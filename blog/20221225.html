    <p><b>
      MERRY CHRISTMAS!!
    </b></p>
    <p>
      in this blogpost, I'll say I'm more than grateful cuz despite everything I've been through, I really appreciate
      the people whom I cherished the most. and it's not just any ordinary people, it's the people who are destined
      to overcome beyond ordinary -- people whom are sealed to do what they wanted to do. vtubers, musicians, artists,
      you name it!!
    </p>
    <p>
      but on this feature, we'll be focusing on two of the most important people who I adore the most and have spent
      my lives with ever since. they're not just your average vtubers, mind you -- they are what I can describe as the
      'backbone' of who I am in this space. they are the kind of people who, despite all the odds, remain true to
      themselves while at the same time try their best to foster the community they built with their best efforts!
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm very proud that I've become the <b>founding father</b> of one (as one of the community members pointed out)
      of them, and since then been sticking to them all throughout my life as a resident vtuber -- made me become the
      💚🍃Aga-chuu💗🌸 that everyone loved!!
    </p>
    <p>
      but suffice to say, she's one of the two people whom I cherished my whole lives with and forever will be in my
      heart for years to come. here's my year-end messages to them below:
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>
      mama dearest (Aura Ostara)💚🍃,
    </b></p>
    <p>
      I'm really grateful that I became a part of your life since your debut a few months ago. your countless dedication
      towards fostering your community has left a big mark in wanting me to dedicate my time with the best I can. I know
      that you've been struggling throughout your time and since then become inactive in most cases, but I just wanted
      to let you know that I will always cherish you and will be with you until the very end of your fulfilling journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      were it not for you in the first place, I'm not who I wanted to be as Mother Agatha with all this hair color and
      everything. in fact, this whole hair color palette is a nod to yours since it was you whom I first devoted myself
      to in the beginning of my vtuber support journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you all the best and hope to keep in touch with you still!! 💚🍃Aga-chuu loves you uwu💗🌸
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: right;">
      best regards,<br>
      💚🍃Aga-chuu💗🌸 / moon

    <p><b>
      mama queenie (Hina Oujo)💗🌸,
    </b></p>
    <p>
      it's been more than months since I get to know you!! being a part of your precious community -- the Chuu-nins --
      has been a fruitful experience for me and I couldn't been more grateful to see you grow and prosper against all
      odds!! from your humble beginnings to becoming a part of a bigger industry, and now a lewdtuber -- you're acing
      every part of it and I've never been more grateful to have you around as one of the friends whom I can lean on.
    </p>
    <p>
      with the beginning of the new year, I'm hoping that our friendship and companionship will still be the same as
      it was before your vtubing carreer as Hina Oujo. I hope that one day I could go beyond what I can achieve so that
      I can attain to my promise of giving you back tenfold.
    </p>
    <p>
      you and mama dearest💚🍃 are precious to me and I'm super grateful to have you both around! let's make the best
      memories together as your precious Dove and Overseer, the 💚🍃Aga-chuu💗🌸 that you can always lean on!
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: right;">
      best regards,<br>
      💚🍃Aga-chuu💗🌸
