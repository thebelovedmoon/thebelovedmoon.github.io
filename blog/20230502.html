      I didn't intend to actually do this, but this is a game that I longed to play ever since I played it that rlly
      got me hooked to the anime. as it shut down last 30 apr at 1am UTC (3am CEST), I was dead set to make it happen
      as soon as I planned it ahead of schedule -- but bombarded by delays due to time constraints and, well, this
      being the shared PC I guess..
    </p>
    <p>
      below is the announcement that the PR made a month before the shutdown:

      it just took me some time to transcribe the whole chorus of the song based on this one, 「Lost Princess」, by
      ear and by memory. took a lot of adjustments afterwards, but it's all worth it in the end!!
    </p>
    <p>
      the end result? this track, wc serves as a ceremonial farewell to the game that brought me mama Kaiser and
      mama Rei. on my next lineup of streams on Twitch (the same username), I'll play back the bgm that put everything
      together.
