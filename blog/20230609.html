    <br>
    <p>
      first of all, <b>thanks for 100 subs on yt!!</b> it's been an absolute pleasure to
      be able to kick back into the youtubing scene after many months of inactivity back
      then. it somehow made me feel nostalgic cuz I've been into making content across
      channels that I invest in, and this channel is one of them.
    </p>
    <h2>how did the channel begin?</h2>
    <p>
      I started the @thebelovedmoon channel as just one of my sub-channels back in 2015
      cuz I've been a diehard JElsa (Jack and Elsa) shipper back in the days of "Rise of
      the Guardians" and "Frozen" to which I myself found an affinity to. below is the
      channel header for that at the time. (and yes, that's my name alright.)
    </p>
    <img src="blog-assets/20191124_ytheader_thebelovedmoon.jpg" alt="">
    <br>
    <p>
      since the life restart last Sep 2019, I've been trying to distance myself from
      everything related to Internet to try and reevaluate myself. 2020 saw as a catalyst
      for my return cuz the content creation that I've been aching to have is lingering,
      wanting me to return to what I do most. this video below is the first video that
      was uploaded to my channel, dated 19 Mar 2020, 4 days after my 27th birthday.
    </p>
    <p class="ytembed">
      <iframe title="thebelovedmoon @ 27" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gwE7PSIB0kg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      it still kept the same "Elsa" spirit that I always had since the channel's inception.
      by the remainder of the year, I tried to change the course of my interests through
      Touhou, KuruHS (wc is still persistent to this day), and Sheet Music Boss.
    </p>
    <p><i>
      and just before the end of the same year, so is the beginning of my time with DEAD OR
      ALIVE Xtreme Venus Vacation (DOAXVV). more on that later.
    </i></p>
    <h2>2021: the era of Arcaea and Horror Shop Games</h2>
    <p>
      when February 2021 rolled through I got my hands on Arcaea, which saw as an opportunity
      for me to try my hand at rhythm games.
    </p>
    <p class="ytembed">
      <iframe title="first time playing #arcaea" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DwsAsUyWAko" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      that gave me multitude of ideas of what content creation I'm investing to in the long
      run at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      July came around and my presence on the Internet changed forever: I heard of Horror
      Shop Games and one of theirs -- Mother -- from ManlyBadassHero and it clicked through
      me that I wanna try it out myself. the videos below were those that started it all in
      its entirety.
    </p>
    <p class="ytembed">
      <iframe title="Mother - Can You Survive A Deadly Encounter With Your Own Mother? ( FULL PLAYTHROUGH )" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gPpsjz_EUFM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    <p class="ytembed">
      <iframe title="Mother loves you, always." src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-SOc41DnFpM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      some days later, I found myself making these contents, and around the time where music
      production became my new routine, I made compos for such sorts.
    </p>
    <p class="ytembed">
      <iframe title="more MOTHERly stuff" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLQZt5lx5sFp8VLCjBoi4BX2pIr0MsGQ8V" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    <p class="ytembed">
      <iframe title="thebelovedmoon's Compositions" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Du--EfLj62A?list=PLQZt5lx5sFp9IuZT97uJAbeNBt6zgjl6s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      that alone gave me a mark that will forever etch in my memory as the day I represent
      myself in the Horror Shop Games community as the revered Mother -- Mother Agatha.
      (backstory on that last bit: jatzy, the main dev of the pact, had thought of the name
      when making the game, and also spilled out the details when asked about the origins
      of the game. a bit fitting as when I realized that was the thing I inadvertently added
      it as a server nickname.. welp, everything went from there.)
    </p>
    <h2>2022: DOAXVV, Yandere Heaven, PriConne, and the genesis of vtubing</h2>
    <p>
      2022 rolled in and I migrated from prepaid consumable to fiber optic ISP. as with it,
      came my interest to upload every single DOAXVV session since I retired from livetweeting
      it on my twtr.
    </p>
    <p>
      but before Valentine's Day (14 Feb) rolled in, I've been uploading things on the prepaid
      consumable to get the gist of what's what. this video was the very first that got me
      into uploading DOAXVV VODs as a whole, therefore resuming my sessions from there.
    </p>
    <p class="ytembed">
      <iframe title="offcam #doaxvv 3 febbraio 2022: Tina's here!!! 🏖" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KKx_-TEUUkg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      during that time, I got into a series of contents surrounding Yandere Heaven, and the
      recently-closed Princess Connect! Re:Dive Global EN. I've recently compiled all of the
      things I had with the latter in this playlist below.
    </p>
    <p class="ytembed">
      <iframe title="Yandere Heaven - Vol.1 (All Routes)" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLQZt5lx5sFp8vH2nOAZQ_I19e015UgRxR" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    <p class="ytembed">
      <iframe title="PriConne EN: thebelovedmoon's Complete Collection" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PU3HybaN1Kc?list=PLQZt5lx5sFp9YVz5sn8D61TsW8U0lYOCN" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      when I saw that I was enthralled with PriConne espc with the two characters -- mama Rei
      and mama Kaiser (Kaiser Insight), I know that I need to do smth to corroborate them as
      much as I can. as such, I represent as mama Rei for GourmetDayLife (wc started as the
      showcase of some of my guildhouses aswell as others), while mama Kaiser when I started
      streming for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      mama Kaiser herself became the catalyst of my desire to become a streamer -- and
      essentially, a vtuber. some origins first tho: I started taking a full interest in the
      vtubing industry upon learning the termination of Uruha Rushia from HOLOLIVE last 24
      Feb 2022. from that on, I vowed to support all the vtubers that I meet in her honor.
      I found some good fwens along the way, the likes of mama RIORIO and <span class="redacted">mama Viv</span>,
      whom I grew up with alongside my first-ever fwen from the vtubing scene -- Lina Scott!!
      July came around when I started streming -- which is mama Kaiser's birthday month (cuz
      her bday is exactly 1 Jul), so it's kinda coincidental in a way.
    </p>
    <p class="ytembed">
      <iframe title="さよなら、まほたん。" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pBaMhP2Z2bo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      everything kicked off without a hitch, with just bandwidth hiccups, but we got it going
      and I was able to find myself well within the vtubing scene in my own pace!!
    </p>
    <p>
      that genesis is still ongoing as I decided by August to represent myself as who I want
      to be -- a Mother whose her responsibility is to take care of whom she cared for.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
      when I begin to kindle with Aura Ostara (mama dearest💚🍃) as we share some similarities,
      I devote to myself to support her with the best I can. and what way to begin that than
      to change the hair and cosmetic colors from purple to green (the former being the
      original png from horrorshopgames) -- a sign of rebirth and kindling of destinies.
    </p>
    <img src="blog-assets/aggie_ostara.png" alt="">
    <br>
    <p>
      everything changed around the time when I begin to connect with Hina Oujo/HinaSukii
      (mama queenie💗🌸) last June, where I used the old png before I changed its colors. and
      with it, come a nickname that will forever leave a mark in my time as a vtuber:
      💚🍃Aga-chuu💗🌸!! (the name has since officiated 11 Jan 2023)
    </p>
    <div class="twtr">

    <p>
      everything that happend in the vtubing scene happend cuz I represent using a png that
      associates with what I represent in the horrorshop community, and made it unique so that
      it can diversify and universalize the experiences of many.
    </p>
    <p>
      starting from August onwards, I've already set the new png into motion -- its first
      actual appearance being on this VOD below.

    <h2>continuing the legacy with DOAXVV</h2>
    <p>
      despite everything, I still can't forget the DOAXVV tradition with most of the vods, with
      the two videos below being before-and-after with the improvements in the design elements.
    </p>
    <p class="ytembed">
      <iframe title="#doaxvv session 125 [8 FEB 2022]" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uGzGrMJut3M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

    </p>
    <p>
      the most of my uploaded videos were DOAXVV recordings as of this blog, and I'm not planning
      on pausing in the long term anytime soon.
    </p>
    <h2>conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      welp, happy 100 subs to me!! hopefully I'll get to make more content on YouTube as we
      look into the diversified future of content creation.
    </p>
