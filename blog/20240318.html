    <br>
    <p>
      this all happend while I was recording the Birthday Special, when I came down to swapping chars
      to output their birthday voicelines. when the time came that I switched to Nagii, all hell
      broke loose -- at timestamp 35:10 (as shown below) it'd become clear that once I set her outfit
      to her White Day one, it tried to load all the resources but failed to do so.
    </p>
    <p class="ytembed">
      <iframe
        title="#doaxvv session 351 [15 MAR 2024]: the First Maria's Birthday Special"
        src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x5dY-qCD_2I?rel=0&start=2110&end=2420"
        frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen>
      </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      now I did a number of trials-and-errors to the point that I instinctively reported this to the
      devstaff via fb (outlined
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.facebook.com/thebelovedmoon/posts/pfbid0stBUkBY1M84w1BU8JZxs1WDyt9voXGAmgMKmG1sw6zRdyJzZsHoLvDEydigdCzksl" target="_blank">here</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      somehow, before working on this blog a few hrs ago I didn't realize that when I initially got
      Nagii's outfit I was on low graphics mode as shown below:
    </p>
    <p class="ytembed">
      <iframe
        title="#FINALLY- ðŸ™Œ #doaxvv"
        src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7xhZZ-x85ZY?rel=0&start=30"
        frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen>
      </iframe>
    </p>
    <p>
      so I decided to take on that approach -- putting graphics on low for the meantime as I swap
      her outfits -- only to realize a few things:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>framerate jumped from 10fps to 30fps, everything felt smooth</li>
        <li>graphics felt old-school for whatever reason</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            where that actually reminded me of ACERE5, the laptop where I first played doaxvv --
            that I repurposed for another NAS laptop
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      immediately, I switched her outfit to the "default" one -- being the Champs Elysees -- and
      reverted back the configuration as shown below:
    </p>
    <img src="blog-assets/20240318_doaxvv_evtSettings.png" alt="">
    <p>
      so far I did the test run of the game and everything went fine, so it might be good for
      Session 352 happening a lil later. I might also go back to the model quality low
      configuration in the next sessions for the sake of framerate, but that'll be limited to a
      max of 2 per tenth session starting from session 350.
    </p>
    <p>
      but until then I hope this'll get fixed immediately so that I can see Nagii in a whiteday
      outfit again, but in much higher quality than in the previous vod.
