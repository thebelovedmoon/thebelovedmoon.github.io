    <h2>what happend over at Cosplay Matsuri 2023</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="blog-assets/cosplaystuff/20240221/IMG_20231230_152314.jpg" alt="missdcosplay and thebelovedmoon at Cosplay Matsuri 2023">
      &mdash; <cite>the first time I met missdcosplay during my debut as a cosplayer. taken 30 Dec 2023</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      this is my first time being in a cosplay convention and being a cosplayer at the same time!!
      prepping for this event is not easy as I need to get my hands on my necessities fast before I
      could rip through the deadlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      let's take a look at how we got there:
    </p>
    <h3>the beginnings</h3>
    <p>
      I once got a tip from some of my close fwens on socials that they're gearing for their spot
      at Cosplay Matsuri, which was entirely new to my ears at the time. but knowing that this is a
      big opportunity for me made me realize that I need to get my hands on it so that the future
      looks bright!!
    </p>
    <p>
      originally, I wanted to set out for CONQuest; but due to many factors leading up to long queue
      lines (<a href="https://philstarlife.com/geeky/989364-conquest-2023-apology-overcrowding-ticket-overselling" target="_blank">this was covered in the news</a>)
      made me rethink abt what to expect from a convention in general. but hearing that Matsuri will
      be a long mile away from its intended start date made me convinced this is the best way to start
      debuting as a cosplayer -- no matter how bad I look (lmao).
    </p>
    <h3>an important dress</h3>
    <p>
      during my first round of purchasing cosplay materials, I was dead set on making sure that the
      materials were as close as the original.
    </p>
    <p>
      one of em was the long-sleeved, squareneck dress I bought from Shopee -- which somehow adheres
      to the same aesthetic but I think this might look like the vroid model I currently have.
      nevertheless, I posted the pic on X:
    </p>
    <div class="twtr">

            updates ever published
            <br><br>
            the dream dress has finally arrived!! might see if it fits perfectly (cuz it&#39;s XL),
            but rn I&#39;m celebrating victory wooo🙌

    <p>
      I tried the outfit myself, and I can confirm it fits perfectly!! there were some creases, but
      that didn't matter since it's fitting for such an occasion!!
    </p>
    <h3>regarding other items and tickets..</h3>
    <p>
      I've also bought off other items from the list which was fitting at the time (until I put em
      on before checking out the convention), and documented em here on X. but for anyone who's
      wondering what items I bought (in order):
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Matte Lipstick Vampire ong Lasting Sexy Matte White Green Lip Gloss Black Velvet Halloween F2A3</li>
        <li>2023 Plus Size Women's Puff Sleeve Hepburn Little Black Dress Short Sleeve Square Neck dress</li>
        <li>UYAAI 2pcs/1pair cosplay Colored Contact Lenses For Eye Contacts Vika Green</li>
        <li>NEW Classic Women 80 D Opaque Footed Tights Pantyhose Thick Stockings Socks</li>
        <li>COrset 25 Steel Bonded Latex Waist Trainer Cincher Slimming Shapewear</li>
        <li>Simple Punk Black Red Velvet Choker Gothic Round Rope Necklaces Vintage Neck</li>
        <li>SLIPRAIN ♥ Natural Hairpiece Women Green Long Wig Fluffy Cosplay Party</li>
        <li>ZXYOUPING 5cm Thickened Silicone Nipple Bra Invisible Push-up Silicone Bra Self-adhesive</li>
        <li>Women Elasticated Belt Stretch Classic Waist Belts Waistband Ladies Girls Dress</li>
        <li>「KAEVE」 SIZE 35-42!! BIG size 2 inch ganmosa/leather/glossy close black heels for women school</li>
        <li>XIANSTORE Beauty Stage Use Exaggeration&ensp;Dark Green False Eyelashes</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      alongside those items, I initially was planning on buying the 3-day pass to make things
      convenient; but I missed the window so I bought all individual passes instead. it doesn't
      cost much as the 3-day passes but I kinda miss the goodies that was on there. might save
      some up again for this year tho.

      well, I mean, this is it!! sure I missed previous two days but having to step foot on this
      complex is beyond my imagination!! been a while since I got out town to extreme extents,
      so this feels like a breath of fresh air!!
    </p>
    <p>
      anyhow, I got some help trying to set up make-up and everything; and since it's my first
      time wearing contact lenses, it feels a bit itchy at first. but anyhow, after I get to wear
      everything I pushed forward for SMX Convention Center, and.. you know the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      got around to any booths, took some pictures, and even got to a first meet-and-greet provided
      by our peeps over at VOLs!! Minazuki Mana, one of their talents, was currently holding her
      leg of the event so it's nice to see that I get to chat with her for the first time!!

      but the most significant of them all was obv meeting up with <b>missdcosplay</b> for the
      first time!! I dunno how many times I swung by her booth, but all I know is she seems pretty
      chill and easy to talk to!!
    </p>
    <p>
      I also took some pictures involving other cosplayers (most of em were representing mama Yor)
      and I got some goodies along the way!! I might update this blog to include a googledrive
      containing these pictures sometime~

    <br>
    <p>
      back in my temp hometown -- Bataan (Region III, PH), SM City Bataan was my one-stop shop
      for all my leisure needs and whatnot. somehow this takes me back -- I began visiting the
      mall when it first opened on 19 May 2023. I hadn't stayed enough back then to see the
      cosplayers, but I got a tip from a relative of some neighbor that they usually come
      around every Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      and yes, I realized that AFTER I made the debut as a cosplayer (see "what happend over at
      Cosplay Matsuri 2023") -- so I had to prep for this moment and wait for a particular
      timing.
    </p>
    <p>
      somehow, I got some training on hand just to get used to things, and it happens that one
      of the training session days was aligned with the cosplay day I planned -- 11 Feb.
    </p>
    <p>
      so I had no time to waste -- washed my clothes and prep them for my first-ever showcase.
    </p>
    <h3>event proper</h3>
    <p>
      I got some fwens over at a Samsung Store at 2nd Flr. above Gate 1, at SM Cyberzone. I
      recently stayed there to <a href="https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/116082444" target="_blank">have this illust done</a>
      which went pretty well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I talked to em abt this venture and they decided to help out -- shoutouts to em for a
      welcoming experience!! even tho I didn't go there to buy stuff, just being able to mingle
      with em increased my morale and expectancy to visit more often. <b>(if anything, it was a
      lot better than the neighboring Power Mac Center where any test you do to an Apple device
      can get the security guards up your a**. tf, Tim Apple??!)</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      anyhow, once that is done, some mall-goers took notice of how I look, cuz when I usually
      cosplay as a fem I always intend on keeping it that way. so the way I walk and interact
      with people had to be taken into account.
    </p>
    <p>
      I actually took a selfie of myself, with another two being taken by a female security
      guard on patrol. she seems nice, I can tell you that.
    </p>
    <p>
      but anyway, some of the onlookers invited me to take pictures with em, which is a bit
      overwhelming but fun. and of course, I had a chance to visit other parts of the mall as I
      go along, greeting every salespeople in the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      .. altho I'm confused by the time I had to switch places, cuz since I cosplay as a fem,
      other people interpreted me as such. buuuuut I guess it's kinda alright, since I'm leaning
      into that gender personally. Idk why, but I feel like being a fem feels nice considering
      that part of me wants to continue doing cosplays in this formfactor.
    </p>
    <h3>had to switch..</h3>
    <p>
      I left SM Bataan after 2 fulfilling hours, and I felt satisfied with the results. somehow
      I forgor to post the conclusion, so I had to put this in a blogpost to make up for it.
    </p>
    <h2>so.. what's next??</h2>
    <p>
      I was actually thinking, since <b>Cosplay Matsuri will be my grand appearance on an annual
      basis</b>, I had to prolly save more to be able to cosplay more characters. here's some
      that I had planned:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Snow White (from SINoALICE), bridal/Mage outfit</li>
        <li>oshi main/Shirokane Rinko (from BanG Dream)</li>
        <li>Minato Yukina (from BanG Dream)</li>
        <li>Sumiyoi Sakura (from Ojou-sama Yomeiri Kousou)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      also, "#AgaCosplay Invades" might continue as we go along, just with an okaasan look for
      now. I might be thinking, since Bataan will be the first point, I might travel around
      the province in this form factor and see what people think.
    </p>
    <p>
      but hey, it's nice to be able to cosplay again after the debut, and here's hoping for more
      sessions to come!!
