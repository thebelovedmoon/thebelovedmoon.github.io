      been a while since I last made a blog 2mos ago. if you guys don't know what happend back there, I got
      very busy with a lot of stuff that I had lil time to basically update the site this blog area belongs
      to. having to juggle between here and EmiiShion is such an overwhelm, but lest I got the hang of it!!
    </p>
    <p>
      you're prolly wondering why this title has to do with the picture you just saw on the top of this page.
      it's a story that I've been excited to work on since a few mos back, and now I get to complete it just
      yesterday full of emotions and happiness. to be honest, I read the story on the fly only to realize
      it's not just a romcom that anyone can read and laugh. it's a story of once a betrayal but ended in a
      disaster unlike any other.
    </p>
    <p>
      thanks again to <b>@butterfly_effect</b> on Wattpad for this story!! I've been interested to read this
      since I need some stories to practice my voice acting skills (call it asmreading), and this story fits
      the criteria!!
    </p>
    <p>
      listen to the LIVE Edition as I prep for the episodic vods on my softlaunched asmr channem cuz of how
      many disconnects there were when I stremed em on Twitch:

    <h2>my honest thoughts abt the story</h2>
    <p>
      srsly, when I first read the first few chapters of the story (without even asmreading it at first) I
      was like "is she always like this?" or "how would a villainess be in there in the first place?", then
      I figured I'd read the whole story while trying to voice act as Kaiser Insight (from Princess Connect!,
      to which I associated with every July of the year), and even tho I somehow suck at it I'd be damned to
      see people appreciating my efforts. it's been a while since I last did voice acting but on a different
      character, so it's both challenging and fun^^~
    </p>
    <p>
      now for the contents of the story: reading throughout the book tells the story of a defeated villainess
      named Lorelei who was stuck in her prison -- the lake -- for more than three thousand years under the
      surveillance of the renowned God of Order (whose name remains unknown). the first time I read it, it
      somehow talks abt how many angsty moments Lori had (nickname for Lorelei accd. to some comments), but
      the more I read the story -- and the more I try to asmread it -- was that the reason for her angst is
      not on impulse, but something not-so-trivial but heartbreaking. halfway through the stories, I realized
      Lori had to take the risk in order to survive and end her suffering, only to fail each time. it's just
      a lil heartbreaking -- I mean, imagine all of the plans and efforts that you put into action as much as
      what Lori had, only to have come to waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      from all the betrayal that she pulled towards her own kind, to what essentially be the next push, made
      us realize that "good things come to those who wait". but for Lori, it's that hard. and I felt that.
      personally, I had that same thought many times during my life that already put me into an endless cycle
      of despair. but like everyone said, "there's the light at the end of the tunnel", and all we can do is
      to keep going.
    </p>
    <p>
      for Lori, the only choice for her is to give up. but little did she know, that God of Order had smth up
      in his sleeve: he took her to many places, bought them many things. but that would only be the start of
      the end for both of em.
    </p>
    <p>
      ch.25 imo took a turn for the worst. after what essentially become the final matches in chess (srsly?),
      the doom dawned upon them, and reading em out loud made me realize that emotions began to pile up from
      within me. Idk if it's anger cuz of the other Gods, or sadness cuz it will seem that Lorelei's journey
      ends there. either way, the way the other Gods demand from the two reminded us of today -- where
      rationality is gone and all we have are excuses. <i>I see you, politics.</i> I read the next chapter in
      advance, and I realized, I just began to cry. Idk why, but it took me quite a few days to prep for this
      moment. I took one more practice just to calibrate my throat, which can be seen below:

    </p>
    <p>
      I took the plunge the day afterward to finally conclude the story -- putting Lori's journey to an end.
      I readied myself, and started reading the final three chapters in the usual asmreading fashion.. but
      adding more somberness to it. I also chose the song that was attached in ch.26 -- "I Love You Boy" by
      SUZY -- for the finale. <i>since then, I've put the whole song on repeat.</i> when I read the whole of
      that chapter until the very end, I could see myself crying in the middle of the stream -- it's too much
      emotional I can't seem to keep up. I just can't..
    </p>
    <p>
      I somehow made it through with the last couple of chapters -- Epilogue and Special -- and with it, comes
      the end of the story. I might be crazy to say this, but if in some cases I'll have to do it again, I'll
      be sure to prepare more tissues than the last time eeee
    </p>
    <p>
      anyhow, despite all the circumstances and hate, Lori seemed to be content about what happend, and she
      felt at ease with her former enemy -- now her lover, and from then on they continued to live happily ever
      after. after streaming, I immediately attached this picture in the strem end post I made on X (twtr):

    <br>
    <p>
      in all seriousness, this story has packed a PUNCH of uncertainties and unexpected events. and I can
      finally say that this deserved more praise than it ever should be beyond all these conditions. I'm happy
      to report that this story gets <b>10 out of 10</b> -- awesome lore, even more awesome duo, and an ending
      we'll never forget!!
    </p>
    <h2>so, what's the next move?</h2>
    <p>
      I've actually announced after gaining a few breaths that I'm softlaunching my ASMR channel on yt, but I'll
      be reading the whole thing again but in chapter-size formfactor. all the mishaps that happend during the
      live sessions should be eased by then.
    </p>
    <p>
      and with it, I might plan on switching my voice acting tactics to be the "okaasan" this time -- my vtuber
      character in all.
    </p>
    <p>
      in addition, although the asmreading series have come to an end, it's only just the beginning of my desire
      as a voice artist -- I'll be having more voicelines as usual, but they'll only be oneshots~
    </p>
    <p>
      lastly, I'll be preparing an artwork of Lori and her lover!! all will be onstream on Twitch and VStream, so
      be sure to follow em for updates:

    <p>
      with that, I hope you enjoy this lil blog as much as I do!! here's to more asmreading in the future~
