      smol update -- updated the names of the two cosers mentioned in this blog!! I'm a bit scared
      abt it tho-
    </i></p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
      this admittedly is my very first 'proper' cosplaying experience that is closer to home, since
      I usually do cosplays in my free time!! caught wind of it during its first day so I thought I
      missed out on it; but upon realizing that there will be a second part the other day, I decided
      to pull it through and wing it -- here are some highlights to keep you in the loop!!
    </p>
    <h2>Bataan Anime Convention 2024</h2>
    <p>
      so admittedly, I'm currently living here in this province since my man Emi was also around here,
      but in terms of cosplaying shenanigans I've always been out of the loop. (for reference, the
      first proper cosplay I went to was Cosplay Matsuri 2023 - Day 3.) oftentimes, I usually cosplay
      myself in random places, just like what I did some times ago. but hey, it took me to places
      where people usually can't see cosplayers, which took the gamble out of me but it was definitely
      worth the patience!! I had a number of friends whom I can appreciate having around since it was
      them among those who encouraged me to cosplay in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I heard all about this convention from an artist fwen of mine who actually had a booth in there
      when I looked at her socials. (in actuality, I saw a number of cosplayers taking public transport
      before I realized, assuming I knew there was a local con there lmao) I thought that I was abt to
      reconsider giving another go whenever the time comes, but I quickly looked up the said convention
      and just realized they had a two-day event there, so I had to just check it out!! opportunity did
      rise tho as I was very eager to get in there with ~style~, so I prepped my cosplay stuff as I
      normally would.
    </p>
    <p>
      only this time, except of transforming to my cosplay self inside the venue, I had let the
      neighborhood see my transformation from within it for the SECOND time. (yes, second time, since
      I did it before which confuses everybody around the perimeter lolz)
    </p>
    <p>
      I also made this note prior to the event:
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="blog-assets/cosplaystuff/20240506/20240504_cosplayAnnounce.png" alt="#AgaChuu at BACon 2024">
      &mdash; <cite>pr image citing my presence at BACon 2024</cite>
    </p>
    <h2>the main event</h2>
    <p>
      somehow I headed into the venue where the convention was taking place -- Vista Mall Bataan -- for
      lunch first before participating for real. it was good tho, had a few chicken and pizza with some
      drinks. had to head out for a bit cuz I had to adjust my breastpads (I got sweaty on the way there)
      but I somehow managed to snag some greetings to some of the fellows throughout the way -- with among
      em being curious on who I was for the first time. I could still remember the conversation I had with
      some of em who told me the exact same thing when they saw me walking outside the resto -- but
      atleast I had quite some talk throughout the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      somehow I had some improvements on the way -- given the fact that I don't have the eyelashes I first
      wore back at Matsuri. main reason for this is that I was looking at the specs (aka the png) again
      and I realized that the eyelashes I used were waaaay too much for me so I had to take em off. I
      opted for a 'cleaner' approach this time -- using simple eyelashes and a mascara. I also had my
      contact lenses again after quite some looong time, since I wanted to try wearing em myself for a
      change of pace. everything still remained the same as it was tho.
    </p>
    <p>
      regardless, I went ahead and visited around booths, to which I can recognize quite a few. (some of em
      were upstairs so I had to take an escalator.) from there, I finally found Haryu's booth -- the one
      that I discovered on X the moment I realized about the con taking place. I even took a snap or three
      -- here's some of em:

    <h2>vtuber gang represent🙌</h2>
    <p>
      one of the booths that I also discovered was literally a vtuber booth -- housed by none other
      than Riikochan!! it somehow felt surreal cuz I haven't seen related booths like that in a
      while (again, among the first were from Matsuri), but to see that its vtuber parents (artists
      and riggers) band together to represent the pact is a sight to behold!! have greeted most of
      the staff there -- here are some to accomodate this paragraph:

      (also, I didn't realize that back on Day 1 there's literally a portion dedicated to vtubers
      -- now all we need are vtubers who are based here in this province other than myself.)

    <h2>the First Maria🍃 meets other cosplayers</h2>
    <p>
      ofc, there won't be a successful convention experience without soem selfies from yours truly
      and some of the cosplayers that she met along the way!! anyway, here are some of em in full
      detail~

    <h2>the First Maria🍃 went to Photography</h2>
    <p>
      now some of the spectators might have noticed that I've gone through many places throughout
      the event with my phone and bag on hand. the reason is simple: I did some attempts at
      photography since I've been missing out on it for so long!! I've been in different booths
      trying my best to cover the best shots -- somehow which some of em may be my absolute
      favorites!!
    </p>
    <p>
      I mighta start working on gettin some more photography work done real soon -- but for now,
      here are the selection!! all of these were taken in 20:9 using Samsung Galaxy A05s~

    <h2>Albedo x First Maria🍃</h2>
    <p>
      <img src="blog-assets/cosplaystuff/20240506/IMG_20240505_153717.jpg" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>the First Maria🍃 meets Albedo!! (cosers: me and Eri)</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      somehow this interaction that I had with Albedo (coser: Eri) aptly reminded me of the last
      time I had with Musashi back at Matsuri (coser: Dani). now that I think abt it, I do feel an
      affinity with both of em cuz of this circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="blog-assets/cosplaystuff/20240221/IMG_20231230_152314.jpg" alt="">
      &mdash; <cite>for reference, here's me and Dani during Day 3 of Matsuri 2023. check out this <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="20240221">blogpost</a> when you're done reading this article.</cite>
    </p>
    <p>
      in fact, she was among the first cosers I met during lunch (the other being Anya) when I was
      looking around booths on my way to the restrooms. somehow those mini-encounters we had were
      significant as we talked about it once things settle down -- we talked a lot about some
      cosplay-related stuff and most importantly, fostered our friendship like never before. I feel
      suuuper grateful having to do something like this; cuz it not only gave me experience in
      portraying certain characters, it helped me get to interact more with people in greater detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      .. maybe we could do a mini-reunion once we meet again in the next con?? not sure abt it, but
      I'm excited either way!! :3
    </p>
    <h2>to the organizers of this convention..</h2>
    <p>
      I would like to send my thanks to all who worked on to make this convention possible!! it's
      been a tumultuous and fulfilling journey and I'm suuuper grateful to have represented vtubers
      in this spectrum along with the others!!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have to admit, it's been a while since I did a proper presence at a convention since during
      my free time I freely cosplay just about everywhere!! it helped me attain confidence in myself,
      and it will certainly help others who also want to pursue a hobby such as this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      in addition, I would like to thank all who worked at the con for the extraordinary hospitality
      to all who participated in those two days!! regardless of my one-day presence, it's been
      the most fulfilling I have in a while!! I'll be sure to drop by again to represent vtubers; and
      most importantly, the Marias -- as we look forward to forging these great moments together~
    </p>
    <h2>want those photo resources?</h2>
    <p>
      are you curious about more content other than the one mentioned here?? look no further -- I've
      compiled all of em (including past cosplays I did) in a unified G Drive folder!! each cosplays
      are grouped into folders named in YYYYMMDD dateformat -- with the first attempt (and my debut
      as a cosplayer) being 20231230!!
    </p>
    <p>
      you can check em out by clicking the button below:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      <button onclick="window.open('https://bit.ly/AgaCosplay');">#AgaCosplay, compiled on Google Drive</button>
    </p>
    <h3>can I use these resources?</h3>
    <p>
      absolutely!! you're all set to check out some of the photos I've taken and the cosplays I did --
      granted that you'll be using them with intent of goodwill. everyone deserves to treat each other
      with positivity, and it's the First Maria🍃's job to ensure that it stays that way!!
    </p>
    <p>
      anyway, be sure to credit me aswell if you're planning on using em!! you can use the following
      included in the below blockquote:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        photo taken by thebelovedmoon, the First Maria🍃<br>
        check out her other works at https://bit.ly/AgaCosplay
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      if you're also planning on posting my cosplays, use the hashtag <b>#AgaCosplay</b> on your socials
      so that I can check it out in my spare time!! you can also send me the URL to your post assuming
      you posted em on my email at <a href="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:jelsa14018@gmail.com">jelsa14018@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>
      read through all of it but didn't understand a single thing? I got you -- here's your bite-sized
      highlights:
    </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>did a 'proper' cosplay close to home at Bataan Anime Convention 2024</li>
        <li>met Haryu-chan (and others)!!</li>
        <li>took a look at some booths -- ended up on a vtuber booth</li>
        <li>did soem selfies with fellow cosplayers and some adlib photography work</li>
        <li>met Albedo -- which reminded me of Musashi back on Matsuri 2023</li>
        <li>sent our love to the organizers who made this possible</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      maaaan it took too long to write some stuff, but I got everything compiled (and hopefully things
      turn out well)!! another one-day experience has been completed on a good note.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't wait to participate in more cosplay conventions than ever before, carrying the flag of
      the Marias and the whole vtuber community -- while at the same time prepping for some typical
      neighborhood cosplays like I usually do!! I wonder which town would I visit next..🤔
    </p>
    <p>
      until the next blogpost!! 💚🍃Aga-chuu loves you uwu💗🌸
