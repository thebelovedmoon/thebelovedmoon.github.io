    <br>
    <p>
      I would like to take this opportunity to thank my precious Leaves, Nimbisouls and Chuu-nins/Sukii's and Kisses
      for supporting me and my accomplices in our journey towards the bright new future through vtubing!!
    </p>
    <p>
      it's been a long while since we made any valuable connections, but today has been one of those that mattered to
      me and for them!! and it's been a ride trying to deal with it together^^~
    </p>
    <p>
      now for the fun part: the main reason I wanted to send this message is because I'll be back to becoming a
      <b>fulltime resident moderator</b> for 💗🌸 (Hina Oujo/HinaSukii), which we had established a long history
      since her first debut back in June 2022 (or even before that, Idk)!!
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope -- on behalf of her community -- that you be able to support us further as we establish a future where
      everyone's love is universal beyond borders!!
    </p>
    <p>
      💚🍃Aga-chuu loves you uwu💗🌸
    </p>

      mama queenie💗🌸,
    </p>
    <p>
      a HUUUGE congrats on your special [re]Debut!! it was fun and entertaining, and it brung us back memories of
      our experiences as a streamer and your long-time supporter.
    </p>
    <p>
      those were some of the most valuable experiences we both shared together with the rest of the community that
      we both established and have since been more lively than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      as we endeavor into a new experience for you as a renowned vtuber, we hope that the memories we fostered
      together throughout a long time will last for eternity.
