      I know there's some capabilities that I haven't been able to express before, but I feel like this will
      be one of the times where I need to prepare myself to unleash it. <b>this will be among one of my
      tough jobs yet.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      being in the vtuber space created a lot of opportunities for me as a resident supporter, and tbh, I'd
      rather spend most of my time being in their community as they're the ones that uplifted my spirit when
      I was down. but this time, it's different -- one of those opportunities is to become among them -- one
      of the community that I longed to support cuz one of my closest and most precious vtubers were there
      gave me an opportunity that I will never forget.

      now I don't have the necessity to disclose such cuz of circumstances (and prolly the policies), but it
      seems that she trusted me enough to take over her position while she recovers back to health. tbh, I
      was rather in deep concern when I read such news, but I feel like I need to do smth to make her feel
      happy, atleast; and to give her back tenfold like I always do as her prime community moderator.
    </p>
    <p>
      you're already thinking, "you're already a vtuber!" well, this time, it's different -- cuz this is the
      fruit of all my hardships as a supporter to give back to the community that I decided to do whatever
      I can to uplift their spirits and support my fellows as we walk along this journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm sure it'll be fun despite the circumstances cuz it allows me to be dynamic and open-minded abt what
      I do for the community. fingers crossed!!ðŸ¤ž
