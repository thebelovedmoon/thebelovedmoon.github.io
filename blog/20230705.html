      my sincerest apologies for the inactivity for the last few days!! I'm sure you're all
      confused about my sudden mentions via other accounts, but let's go back from the
      beginning to see how it all went down.

            To address extreme levels of data scraping & system manipulation, we’ve
            applied the following temporary limits:

    <p>
      the rate-limiting twt posted by Elon had a major impact on the users, that in some cases
      they have been complaining abt not seeing others' tweets until a certain point. for me,
      Idk if it was related with the twt I posted cuz the feed on my Ubuntu PC (initially) wasn't
      showing, but I can tweet just fine. I'm not rlly sure if some trends broke twtr or it
      relates to the rate limits (tho I doubt on the latter), but
    </p>
    <p>
      as soon as I realized that was a thing, I took some precautionary measures and looked for
      some recommendations abt ways to 'still see twts' despite the rate limits. more on that on
      the next heading.

      I took the risk to implement that, to the point that it gets pretty confusing already. I
      mean, the navigation between the old and new twtr (which imo the former brings back
      memories) became a chore. who would've thought that the <code>mobile.twitter.com</code>
      that I usually navigate to is already redirected to <code>twitter.com</code>? either way,
      the ONLY way to bring the new UI is to append <code>?newtwitter=true</code> at the end of
      the url.
    </p>
    <p>
      anyway, as soon as I realized that, I disabled the extension. not cuz the new twtr ui is
      amazing (admittedly I like the change of pace), but I don't wanna risk getting 'flagged as
      a bot' which will be in the next heading.
    </p>
    <h2>This request looks like it might be automated.</h2>
    <p>
      as I try to interact after disabling the extension, the twt refuses to send a message.
      every time I try to interact -- sending likes, retweeting, and even saving a tweet as a
      draft -- doesn't do anything. they all returned this ANNOYING dialog as shown below.

      I decided to continue finding a workaround for a fix, which includes having to use a phone
      for this operation, as well as using a VPN. but even that didn't work, which infuriated me
      as the latter part employed a different IP.

      which led me to believe that this so-called 'account flagging' is done AT AN ACCOUNT LEVEL.
    </i></b></p>
    <p>
      out of sheer frustration, I researched this whole flagging thing on google and found an
      <a href="https://growfollowing.com/twitter-request-looks-automated" target="_blank">article</a>
      by Grow Following about potential reasons and ways to remediate the issue. feeling defeated
      by the sole purpose of an extension, I decided to take a break from my account and scramble
      myself across accounts I own -- primarily GourmetDayLife. (I initially went for SakuraSumiyoi
      but I don't want my existing followers to know abt this r18 acct in the first place; not to
      mention the amount of absurdity I retweeted in most cases, which makes SakuraSumiyoi the
      SakuraSumiyoi everyone knows about.)

      it timed that I was about to stream the following day, so I used my PR to know that I'll
      temporarily switch accounts at the moment while at the same time announcing the stream. the
      stream ended successfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      other events, like the Daily Kaiser, was also moved to that account as well as a temporary
      measure, since the account in question is originally for the topic -- Princess Connect!
      Re:Dive. I somehow became surprised that the same IP that had my mainstream account flagged
      didn't affect my accounts, as I have 5 logged in to the same browser instance (thanks
      multiple accounts feature).
    </p>
    <p>
      but my quest for waiting has gone far enough, and tried to interact with the tweeters after
      a few hours initially. it went just fine, until a few interactions later. I was about to
      reply to one of my moots when the dialog kicked in again. but atleast I got the gist of what
      to do when things go down south.
    </p>
    <p>
      fast-forward to multiple hours leading to the release of this blog (tho I tried interacting
      again while writing this one), and everything went fine!! I was now able to do the primal
      interactions like I used to, and even tweeted some things in the process!! I'm technically
      back in full force -- but I need to publish this blog first before I go amok in tweeting
      and stuff.
    </p>
    <h2>conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      while it's a necessity that some external services offer anti-tracking and bypass from the
      limits as the author of the extension claimed, ALWAYS be careful in utilizing them. I'd
      best recommend that you do that thing in a testing environment, or on an account that you
      feel like interacting less. that way, your usual activities will stay at a normal state.
    </p>
    <p>
      while we're at it, I would like Elon and Twitter to reconsider the consequences when it comes
      to these limits and more (not to mention accessing TweetDeck requires subscribing to Twitter
      Blue), because not everyone can afford the service, you know? I might, but that's my
      discretion. if people absolutely aren't paying for Blue, then atleast be considerate
      towards your users. if you don't, people will then switch to a rival social network that
      will outweigh the possibilities of your platform. I understand this is for money, but which
      comes first: investors or the users? <b>don't try to be YouTube and their YouTube Premium
      tactics where adblocking can limit how users watch videos, cuz Google cares more about
      advertisers than their users anyhow.</b>
    </p>
    <h2>tl;dr</h2>
    <p>
      in a nutshell: after trying the OldTwitter extension in awareness of the tweet limits, I find
      myself back into the nostalgia (which didn't end quite well), and having my mainstream account
      'flagged as a bot' that I resorted to GourmetDayLife out of defeat.
    </p>
    <h2>remarks</h2>
    <p>
      <b>don't take these extensions too lightly.</b> even if they promise a tracking prevention and
      bypass to the limits (or anything Twitter enforces in the future), there's no certainty that
      it'll be the same once you step out of that department. your account might get flagged or
      locked, or worse, getting banned indefinitely without an appeal. make backup accounts if you
      want to, and disclose as much info as possible if things went south or sideways.
