          <p>
            hi!! my name is <b>thebelovedmoon</b>, aka 💚🍃Aga-chuu💗🌸.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            since my inception on July 2022, I have been equally eager and grateful to embark on the
            new milestone that is vtubing. I was always seeking out opportunities, refining my hobbies,
            and making all sorts of new friends along the way. 
          </p>
          <p>
            things don't go as planned sometimes.
          </p>
          <p>
            following mama Hina's (formerly mama Suzu) retirement as an AuroraLiveVR talent, I was
            considered to take up the role and fill the gap that was her absence. I was entrusted with
            a volunteer role that introduced me to the rest of the AuroraLiveVR community that I am
            still a part of to this day. I made various friends and associates that I now consider my
            closer circle of vtuber friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            while things were optimistic at first, my performance is affecting my desire to continue and
            so <b>the company and I have mutually agreed to retire me as an AuroraLiveVR talent.</b>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            not all hope is lost, however, as I am entrusted to keep Emii's legacy going in a different
            way.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Emii Shion【絵美紫苑】👑🐣 won't be going anywhere.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently making the steps toward presenting myself as a vtuber and properly
            distinguishing myself as a content creator. while I still set up the necessary overlays
            provided on my departure, One of these preparations involves saving up enough money to finally
            have acquired the model Emii Shion and have the (lost) memory of her join me in my journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            if you are able, do support me on this journey and quest to keep her memory alive by sending a
            tip and watching the streams!! <b>the goal to make this a reality is €1500.</b>
          </p>

          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I invite you all to a special announcement where we lay out the next plan for what's next for
            Emii. (spoiler -- it'll still be the same, but upgraded!!) that will come into effect this
            coming Friday, 24 Feb 2023, on Emii's Twitch channel.  
          </p>

          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            with that said, though I'm not officially an ALVR talent anymore, I'll still be around as a
            community moderator on the ALVR Community Discord and a resident supporter to the rest of the
            active talents -- especially those in Royalence👑!! I'm wishing all of the talents the best
            along with their communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            see you soon! 💚🍃Aga-chuu loves you uwu💗🌸
